# Analysis-of-Solar-Wind-Speed-Variations-and-Space-Weather-Impact-Using-RNN

This study investigates and predicts variations in the speed of the solar wind, important for understanding its impact on space weather and the Earth's magnetic field, generating phenomena such as auroras. Using an LSTM neural network, the goal is to predict solar wind speed for the next five periods, anticipating changes in space weather.
